This archive contains the following files:

**ZAB_HiRes_workflow.nb.html** – This R Markdown document includes the code used to create plots and calculate statistics reported in the manuscript. 
It is possible to download the full R code from this file. The code can then run if placed in the same file directory as the data files listed below.

**Chrono_Tornado.csv** – This file contains varve count results specifically referenced to images of biogeochemical scanning data (μXRF elements and HSI pigments).

**ZAB_CNS_2020.csv** – This file contains results of destructive sediment analyses (Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Dry Bulk Density, Cesium-137). 
Varve thicknesses are also included (standardized to depths in core ZAB-20-1).

**ZAB_HiRes_HSI.csv** – Results of Hyperspectral Imaging indices.

**ZAB_HiRes_XRF.csv** – Results of μXRF scanning (elements). Units are counts per second. 

**meteo_1966_2020.cs**v – Daily meteorological data from Kętrzyn, Poland (Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management – National Research Institute).
